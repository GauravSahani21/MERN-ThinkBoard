<h1 align="center">📝 MERN Stack Note Taking App ✨</h1>

visit: https://mern-thinkboard-1-c01d.onrender.com

ThinkBoard is a simple and intuitive note-taking web app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and save notes in real time. Designed with a clean UI and smooth user experience, ThinkBoard is perfect for managing thoughts, tasks, or study notes—all in one place. It’s my first full-stack project that showcases CRUD functionality and seamless integration between frontend and backend.

Highlights:

- 🧱 Full-Stack App Built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- ✨ Create, Update, and Delete Notes with Title & Description
- 🛠️ Built and Tested a Fully Functional REST API
- ⚙️ Rate Limiting with Upstash Redis
- 🚀 Completely Responsive UI
